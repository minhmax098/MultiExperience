# MultiExperience

MULTIPLAYER AR USING ANCHORS USING ARCORE 

Now there's a few thing I want to clarify. While I was experimenting with Cloud Anchors. First of all, you'd expect ARCore's Cloud Anchors to give you the full multiplayer experience. 

Meaning that once you hosted your cloud anchor, it would be easy to update the anchors and have them continously resolve just like normal multiplayer games.

So Cloud Anchors are great for instantiating a game object once off, like maybe an AR sculpture or 3D map on multiple devices, that will work just fine.
